__Short description:__ Catmandu (<http://librecat.org>) is a command line tool to access and convert data from your digital library, research services or any other open data sets. With Catmandu you can:

* download data via protocols such as OAI-PMH, SRU, SPARQL and Linked Data Fragments.
* convert formats library format such as MARC, MODS, Dublin Core and but also others like JSON, YAML, XML, Excel and many more.
* generate RDF and speak the Semantic Web.
* index data into databases such as Solr, Elasticsearch and MongoDB.
* use a simple Fix language to convert metadata into any format you like.

After a short introduction to Catmandu and its features, we will present the command line interface (CLI) and the domain specific language (DSL). Participants will be guided to *extract* data from files and APIs, to *transform* data records to a common data model and to *load* it into a data store. We will also show how your data can be enriched via API look-ups.
